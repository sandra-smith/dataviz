        <h1>The Rising Price of a Degree</h1>
        <p class="byline"><strong>By Sandra Smith</strong></p>
        <p class="subtitle">Since the early 2000s, college tuition and student loan debt in the U.S. have increased
            drastically, outpacing wage growth. This has left recent graduates under much financial strain.</p>

            <h2>Tuition Costs</h2>
            <p>Private nonprofit universities remain the most expensive institution type, with out-of-state public
                universities close behind. Average tuition costs range from about $8,000 for in-state two year schools
                to more than $45,000 at some private universities.</p>

            <h2>Loan Crisis</h2>
            <p>Despite efforts by past presidents to relieve the burden of student loan repayments, such as former
                President Obama's Pay As You Earn (PAYE) plan and former President Biden's Saving on a Valuable
                Education (SAVE) plan, the total amount of federal student aid has tripled since 2010. As of September
                2023, 43 million U.S. borrowers collectively owed over $1.6 trillion in federal student loans, which
                exceeds both auto loan and credit card debt in the U.S.</p>

            <h2>Access by Region</h2>
            <p>The scatterplot compares average in-state tuitions to median household incomes by region. Although there
                is no direct correlation between the cost of college and state median income, data highlights a gap
                between growing tuition prices and stagnant wages.</p>

            <h2>Debt Distribution</h2>
            <p>The treemap shows how student loan debt is distributed across loan balance categories. Data from the
                National Center for Education Statistics reveals a racial disparity in debt distribution, with Black and
                American Indian students more likely to carry higher levels of debt compared to their white and Asian
                peers.</p>

            <h2>Tuition Comparison</h2>
            <p>These two maps show the change in average in-state tuition across the U.S. from 2012 to 2023. Over the
                past decade, tuition has risen significantly nationwide. In 2012-2013, the highest average in-state
                tuition was $24,705 in New Hampshire. By 2023, Vermont topped the list with an average of $30,887.</p>

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                The rising cost of college and mounting student loan debt remain urgent issues. The Trump administration
                resumed student loan repayments on May 5 and made clear there would be no broad loan forgiveness during
                his term. "We're in the worst student loan landscape that we've ever been before," Sabrina Calazans,
                executive director of the Student Debt Crisis Center, told
                <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/student-loan-collections-restart-explained-rcna204494"
                    target="_blank">NBC</a>.
                For borrowers struggling to manage repayment, enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan or applying
                for loan rehabilitation may offer some relief.
